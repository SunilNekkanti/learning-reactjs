React Basics:
----------

	* The big idea behind React is this: what if you could create your own HTML element that has customized functionality
	* For example, one could make a <CommentBox> element that would display a textarea, run validations on the text typed into the textarea, submits the form when the enter key is pressed, etc â€” all just by including one line of code: <CommentBox></CommentBox>

		Components(React)  <=>  Directives(Angular)

		<HomePage>
			<Header tab-selected="home">
			<ScrollingBanner>Welcome to my webpage!</ScrollingBanner>
			<p> Enter your info  if you want to get in touch </p>
			<ContactForm />
			<Footer />
		</HomePage>

		Custom HTML Tags with Custom Functionality

		React isn't a MVC
		Doesn't use Templates
		React really shines when your data changes over time.
		In Angular, Data Binding is done via linking function

		When a Component is initialized, it calls the render() to render a lightweight representation of the view.
		From that representatio, a string of markup is produced and injected into the document.
		When the data changes, render() is called again.
		To perform updates efficiently, differentiate the old value from new one and generate minial set of changes to be applied to the DOM.
		Tying functionality directly to markup and packaging it in a portable, self contained "component" will make you happier and less filthy in general.
